## How to Make a Chalmers Cards

If you have access to your own laser and want to get started printing your own, the files for the cards are [on Github](https://github.com/misterchalmers/ChalmersCards).

If you don't have access to a printer or are inexperienced, come visit us or send us a message and we can schedule a time to go to a maker space (usually HackLab TO) to print some cards.  Some ways to find us:
