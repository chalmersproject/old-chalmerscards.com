This is the repo for the [Chalmers Cards](https://chalmerscards.com) civic tech project. It is built using plain HTML and CSS3, and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

If you want to help out, you'll find us at [Civic Tech Toronto](https://civictech.ca) on Tuesdays or send us a message on the #info-cards-4-homeless channel on [Slack](https://civictechto.slack.com)
